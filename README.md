# Relighting_pytorch
We base our CycleGAN implementation on https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN. We modified it to make it usable for our dataset.
We also developed tools to prepare our dataset that is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FdQCDQNjmB4YNV8yZZZgsnidOumfCNfI that we generated using Unreal Engine 4.

The report for this project is available here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/fzrzzfvnrghy.
